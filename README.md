## Features
- **Modern UI/UX**: A clean, responsive, and intuitive interface built with React and TypeScript.

- **Simple 3-Step Process**: A guided workflow: Job Setup → Upload Resumes → View Results.

- **Real-time Processing**: Live progress indicators provide immediate feedback during uploads and screening.

- **Advanced Filtering & Sorting**: Easily sort and filter candidates by match score, name, or category.

- **Bulk Operations**: Download all or just the shortlisted resumes as a single .zip file.

- **Secure Authentication**: Complete user authentication flow including sign-up, login, forgot password, and OTP email verification.

- **BERT Embeddings for Semantic Matching**: Understands the context of the job description and resume, not just keywords, using Sentence Transformers.

- **Multi-Format File Processing**: Extracts text seamlessly from PDF and DOCX files.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
```bash
Category                Technology

Frontend                React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons

Backend                 Flask(Python), Supabase (PostgreSQL), NLTK, Sentence Transformers, scikit-learn

Document Processing     PyPDF2, python-docx

AI/ML Libraries         sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, nltk, numpy
```

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+

- Node.js 16+ (for the frontend)

- A free [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account

- A Gmail account with 2FA enabled (for sending OTP emails)

## 🚀 Quick Start
### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project from GitHub and navigate into the root directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitinlodhi019/AI-Resume-Screener.git
cd "AI Resume Screener"
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory, create a virtual environment, and install the required Python packages.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and install the required Node.js packages.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Environment Configuration
In the backend directory, create a .env file. 
```bash
# Supabase Credentials
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Gmail SMTP Credentials for OTP
SMTP_USER=your.email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
```

### 5. Database Setup (Supabase)
Log in to your Supabase dashboard and run the following SQL query in the SQL Editor to create the users table.
```bash
-- Create the users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone TEXT,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    otp TEXT,
    is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    role TEXT,
    hr_id TEXT,
    full_name TEXT,
    position TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 6. Run the Application
You'll need to run the backend and frontend in two separate terminals.

**Terminal 1: Run the Backend (from the backend directory)**
```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
flask run or python app.py
```
Your backend will now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

**Terminal 2: Run the Frontend (from the frontend directory)**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Your frontend will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:5173.

## AI/ML Pipeline Explained
The resume screening process is a multi-stage pipeline designed for accuracy and relevance.

1. Text Extraction: The system first extracts raw text from uploaded files, supporting .pdf and .docx formats.

2. Text Preprocessing: The raw text is cleaned using NLTK. This involves removing URLs, converting to lowercase, tokenizing, removing stop-words, and lemmatizing words.

3. Skill & Category Extraction: The processed text is scanned to identify hundreds of predefined skills and to assign the resume a primary job category (e.g., "Tech", "Design").

4. Scoring Algorithm: A final score is calculated using a weighted average of three key metrics:

    - Semantic Similarity (15%): Uses BERT embeddings to compare the contextual meaning of the resume against the job description.
    
    - Skill Match (75%): The most important factor. It's the percentage of required skills found in the resume.
    
    - Experience Match (10%): Analyzes the resume text for years of experience or keywords like "senior" to match the required experience level.

## API Endpoints
A comprehensive RESTful API powers the application.
